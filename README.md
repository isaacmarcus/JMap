# JTC " JMap "

## Purpose of this WireFrame App

The key project of my internship at JTC involved developing an app that provided information on-site for field officers in a readily accessible interface. Prior to the creation of the app, officers had to access information through hard copy reports that were not easily accessible. This app wireframe was created using "Framer" that lets users utilize "Coffeescript" based of Javascript to create more responsive and interactive design.

## Key Modules / Features

1. Usability Testing
2. User Research
3. Working with Developers
4. UI/UX Design

## Logo Design

I was also tasked to design the logo, and here are some iterative designs from 2D to a 3D Logo
